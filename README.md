# Ranked-Voting
An interactive ranked voting machine program in java meant to be used by a small community.
Goals of program;
To implement an interactive voting machine program for a small committee that wants to try ranked voting instead of just majority wins.

*For this problem, ranked voting means that when a person votes they provide 3 prioritized candidates (a first choice, a second choice, and a third choice).

The candidates must have been nominated (be on the ballot) and must not be duplicates (first choice, second choice, and third choice must all be unique).

The committee does not know which ranked voting algorithm they want to use, and so they want to be able to program the voting machine at runtime to try different ones.

The committee is concerned about information security as they extend your code, and so the logic you build must be well encapsulated as to not let the data be manipulated in any way other than by nominating a candidate or casting a vote. Even by a voting strategy implementation.
